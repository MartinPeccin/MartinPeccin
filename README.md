Hi there! My name is MartÃ­n, and I'm an electronic engineer with over a decade of experience in the world of technology and teamwork. Actually, I serve as an IT Manager at the Honorable Deliberative Council of BahÃ­a Blanca.

Passionate about technology and teamwork, I love challenges and being part of the solution. Currently my focus is on IoT technology development, where I have two years of experience working with C/C++, microcontrollers, sensors, TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL database management. Recently, together with the team from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (UNS), we successfully created a prototype of legislative electronic voting system using an Iot architecture.

Throughout my career, I have integrated my expertise into various roles, demonstrating proficiency as an IT technical support specialist, web developer, and in IT manager tasks, working with multidisciplinary teams and stakeholders.
